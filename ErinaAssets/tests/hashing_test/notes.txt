aHash and wHash both seem to have great accuracy
Surprinsingly, dHash does not perform as great as expected (everyone talks about dHash on internet but seems to have bad accuracy (59/157 ; na/160 ; 82/160))
I thought that phash would have better performance (had high expectation about it but now I'll need to reanalyze the animes I already added to the DB) (110/157 ; 91/160 ; 100/160)

Results
---------------------
Test 1:     wHash 129/157   -   aHash 126/157
Test 2:     wHash 122/160   -   aHash 124/160
Test 3:     wHash 124/160   -   aHash 124/160

--> Might use aHash for its speed with a threshold (using the hamming distance)
Thinking of a threshold of 3 ã€œ 5
